## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how to implement mobile first design. Added some @media queries for different screen sizes. Also learned about tables in CSS.

Code snippets, see below:

```css
@media (min-width: 90rem) {
    .container {
        width: 46rem;
        flex-shrink: 0;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

Would like to take on more complex projects with multiple pages or modals before adding some JS in future.
